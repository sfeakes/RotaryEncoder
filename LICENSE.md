# License types
## Non Commercial Project

All non commercial projects can be run using our open source code under GPLv2 licensing. As long as your project remains in this category there is no charge.

## Prototyping

If you are working on a prototype that may lead to a commercial product, you can start off using the Open Source Code under GPLv2 for free. However, once the project is commercialised, you need to change to a Commercial license.

## Commercial Application

Once your end device or application is commercial you need to either open the source code of your end product completely to continue using aqualinkd free of charge under GPLv2 license or alternatively purchase a Commercial license.

If you are unsure which type of license is right for you, contact us to discuss.

## Non Compliance and License Incompatibilities
Integrating RotaryEncoder software in a commercial product without fully releasing your source code or purchasing a commercial license can have legal ramifications. You agree to the terms under GPLv2 as you integrate our source code.

Incompatibilities, through taking different components of different sources and ignoring any license restrictions, can result in the software pieces you choose not to be permitted to be used in a single product.
